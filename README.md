# Copilot Sherlock — Governed Incident Investigation CLI

**AI proposes. Humans decide. The system verifies.**

Sherlock is a CLI system that turns raw production evidence into a governed, auditable incident decision.

It demonstrates how to build production-grade AI assistance with:
- mandatory human authority
- organizational memory (without feedback loops)
- operational execution
- external cryptographic verification

**AI never decides. Humans always decide.**

## 🎯 The 90-Second Pitch

**Sherlock separates intelligence from authority.**

AI performs bounded reasoning.  
Humans make the decision.  
The system enforces governance, records memory, executes actions, and proves integrity.

Every incident outcome is:
- explicitly approved or rejected by a human
- immutable once finalized
- cryptographically verifiable without trusting the system itself

This is not an AI demo.  
It’s an **incident lifecycle system with AI inside it**.
