# Copilot Sherlock — Governed Incident Investigation CLI

**AI proposes. Humans decide. The system verifies.**

Sherlock is a CLI system that turns raw production evidence into a governed, auditable incident decision.

It demonstrates how to build production-grade AI assistance with:
- mandatory human authority
- organizational memory (without feedback loops)
- operational execution
- external cryptographic verification

**AI never decides. Humans always decide.**
