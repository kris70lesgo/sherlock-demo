# Incident Coordination Record: INC-456
# Multi-Service Incident Declaration
#
# Purpose: Documents which services are involved in an incident
#          and their relationship to the failure
#
# IMPORTANT: This does NOT determine root cause.
#            Each service undergoes independent analysis and governance.

coordination_notes:
  - "Auth failures triggered retry storm in api-gateway at 18:30 UTC"
  - "Storage latency began at 18:25 UTC (5 minutes before auth alerts)"
  - "No auth service defects identified - alert was symptom of downstream issues"
  - "API Gateway amplified problem through aggressive retries"
  - "Root cause investigation focused on storage_service resource exhaustion"

# Service role definitions:
#
# primary_candidate:
#   - Most likely root cause
#   - Must have finalized Phase 4 review to close incident
#   - Gets full remediation tracking
#
# downstream_impact:
#   - Affected by primary but not causal
#   - May have contributing factors worth addressing
#   - Gets remediation if issues found
#
# symptom_only:
#   - Surfaced alert but no fault
#   - No remediation required
#   - Notification only in Phase 6
#
# CRITICAL: These roles are DECLARED by incident commander,
#           not inferred by AI or automation.
#
# DO NOT EDIT DURING ACTIVE INCIDENT
# Changes must go through incident commander approval
