Tasks:
1. Build a minute-by-minute timeline leading up to the incident
2. Identify the PRIMARY root cause
3. Identify any CONTRIBUTING factors
4. Explicitly list NON-CAUSES that were considered and ruled out
5. Identify the exact commit responsible (hash + message)
6. Explain why this change caused the incident (causal chain)
7. Identify detection gaps (what signals were missing or too late)
8. Propose concrete remediation and prevention steps
9. Assign confidence scores (0–100%) for your conclusions
