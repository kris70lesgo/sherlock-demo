# AI Proposal (Phase 3 Output)
ai_proposal:
  primary_root_cause: "Resource allocation cascade failure (65% confidence)"
  confidence: 65  # 0-100%
  ruled_out_count: 4

# Human Decision (Phase 4)
human_decision:
  decision: MODIFIED  # ACCEPTED | MODIFIED | REJECTED
  final_root_cause: "File descriptor exhaustion (specific resource type)"
  final_confidence: 80  # 0-100%

# Overrides (if decision = MODIFIED)
overrides:
  - field: root_cause
    original_value: "Resource allocation cascade failure (65% confidence)"
    new_value: "File descriptor exhaustion (specific resource type)"
    rationale: "Kernel logs show ulimit hit at 23:17:47 - more specific than generic resource failure"
  - field: confidence
    original_value: "65"
    new_value: "80"
    rationale: "Kernel evidence provides concrete proof of root cause mechanism"

notes:
  - "Correlation with kernel logs (dmesg) confirms file descriptor limit"
  - "ulimit -n output: 1024 (default), allocation failures align with this threshold"
